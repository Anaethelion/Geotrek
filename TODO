* Check form non field error

==============
Known problems
==============

* ``dumpdata`` management command will not output the Z coordinates when
  present. Chaining dumpdata and loaddata will therefore not work.
* If map view is to wide, no background layer is displayed (c.f. WMS écrins)
* Breakpoints on onLayerAdd and onLayerRemove triggered twice at page load which
  seems to indicate that some layers (or features?) are unecessarily loaded. To
  further investigated.


==========
Soon...
==========

* Refactor Topology.overlapping() : should not receive queryset

* Should not be necessary to call "existing()" on each manager

* Split and simplify formfield.js

* Release Leaflet.measure

* Set ON DELETE on tables https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.on_delete

* Make application optional (ex: remove dependancies from core)

* Make mapentity generic : no notion of Caminae (move templates to common/, move attachments)
* Split django-mapentity

* Put bbox only once (4326 = human readable, usual form, cf. docs écrins)

* Split django-floppyforms-leaflet

* Django model translations : default language to avoid excluding form fields ? Auto-add all fields
  for all declared languages ?

* Improve cobertura score ? http://geobi.makina-corpus.net/ecrins-sentiers-ci/job/ecrins-sentiers-tests/152/cobertura/?
* Something is wrong with logger configuration, messages coming from caminae
  appear twice in the console (see syncdb output)

* Switch to django-bootstrapped instead of embedding it

* List TODO in Hudson
* Generate project docs with Sphinx

* Use localstorage instead of Django sessions for navigation history and last search

* Remove core dependancies to other apps (registry?)

One day...
==========


* Idea ? Process .sql files with template engine. Provide small tags 
  like {% table Path %} {% field Path.geom %}.
  This would prevent from having hard-coded tablenames.
  SELECT {% field Path.name %} FROM {% table Path %}

* Docstrings for each model
* Help text for each model field
* Test cache (locmem + files + expires)

* Fields computed at DB-level should be read-only for Django. (Standard
  models.Model.save() method will insert/update all non-PK fields).
* See how django manage an instance being a parent of two different child
  instance in the case of multi-table inheritance. Could it be troublesome?

* Fix bug db_column in django-modeltranslation https://code.google.com/p/django-modeltranslation/issues/detail?id=83

* Improve installation of GDAL
* Clean-up buildout directory (all in one "env")
* When changing ``dim`` parameter on a GeometryField, South does not alter nor
  drop/create the field
