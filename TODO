==============
In this sprint
==============

* Use AutoField (serial) for code fields
* Remove db_column for translated fields
* Reset migrations
* Why initial SQL is loaded twice during syncdb?

==========
One day...
==========

* Docstrings for each model
* Help text for each model field
* Fix bug db_column in django-modeltranslation https://code.google.com/p/django-modeltranslation/issues/detail?id=83
* Improve installation of GDAL
* Clean-up buildout directory (all in one "env")
* Fields computed at DB-level should be read-only for Django. (Standard
  models.Model.save() method will insert/update all non-PK fields).
* See how django manage an instance being a parent of two different child
  instance in the case of multi-table inheritance. Could it be troublesome?
